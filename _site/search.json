    "text": "I am a PhD student in Psychology at the Centre for Human Brain Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. I am a recipient of the Government Scholarship for Overseas Study (公費留學獎學金), funded by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan.\nI am supervised by Prof. Patricia Lockwood, Prof. Matthew Apps, and Dr Todd Vogel. I am intrigued by the behavioural, computational and neural mechanisms underlying social learning and group decision-making in health, disease, and development. I am currently using Bayesian computational modelling to explore the causal role of mPFC in people’s susceptibility to social influence."
