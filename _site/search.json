    "section": "",
    "text": "People differ in their levels of impulsivity and patience, and these preferences are heavily influenced by others. Previous research suggests that susceptibility to social influence may vary with age, but the mechanisms and whether people are more influenced by patience or impulsivity remain unknown. Here, using a delegated inter-temporal choice task and Bayesian computational models, we tested susceptibility to social influence in young (aged 18–36, N=76) and older (aged 60–80, N=78) adults. Participants completed a temporal discounting task and then learnt the preferences of two other people (one more impulsive and one more patient) before making their choices again. We used the signed Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the magnitude and direction of social influence. We found that, compared to young adults, older adults were relatively more susceptible to impulsive social influence. Factor analyses showed that older adults with higher self-reported levels of affective empathy and emotional motivation were particularly susceptible to impulsive influence. Importantly, older and young adults showed similar learning accuracy about others’ preferences, and their baseline impulsivity did not differ. Together, these findings suggest highly affectively empathetic and emotionally motivated older adults may be at higher risk for impulsive decisions, due to their susceptibility to social influence."

    "text": "People often adjust their behaviours and preferences to align with others, a phenomenon termed social inﬂuence or social contagion. Social inﬂuence can have a profound effect on our economic preferences, with important implications for ﬁnancial decision-making and making rational choices. Here we review recent ﬁndings in neuroeconomics, elucidating the psychological, computational, and neural mechanisms that underpin social inﬂuence during value-based decision-making. We examine how others’ decisions can shift our own economic preferences, regarding risk-taking, temporal discounting, effort discounting, and moral preferences. Additionally, we discuss the lifespan similarities and differences in susceptibility to social inﬂuence. Finally, we cover studies revealing the neural basis of susceptibility to social inﬂuence and highlight key common brain areas across studies that could underpin these effects. We end by considering the implications of strong evidence of susceptibility to social inﬂuence on economic preferences, the challenges and opportunities of this inﬂuence and how future studies could harness it to create positive changes across the lifespan."
