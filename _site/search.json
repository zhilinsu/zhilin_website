    "section": "",
    "text": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been associated with economic and social decision-making in neuroimaging studies. Several debates question whether different ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and non-social cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to mPFC (N = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (N = 17), and healthy controls (N = 71) (total N = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, area 9; permutationbased threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) p &lt; 0.025). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards (permutation-based TFCE p &lt; 0.05). We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting. These findings provide causal evidence for sub-regions of the mPFC underpinning fundamental social and cognitive processes."

    "section": "Q1 | 選擇申請哪裡？",
    "text": "Q1 | 選擇申請哪裡？\n沒有意外的話，讀博士班是至少花費 3–7 年、成本很高的一筆投資（還不確定嗎？）。 選擇自己生活起來最舒適、最能發揮自己學術潛力、最符合自己學術興趣與職涯發展的地方是最重要的—簡單來說，就是與自己適配度（fit）最高的地方。我覺得可以至少從三個層面來思考要申請的學校：地區、學校、指導教授。\n\n地區\n英國/歐陸與北美的博士班運作邏輯非常不一樣。\n英國/歐陸博士班訓練方式類似「師徒制」，除了少數 Integrated PhD 外，沒有必修課程（所以通常會希望申請者有碩士學位）或典型的資格考制度1，一進去博班就開始為自己的博士論文犧牲奉獻。 如果認為自己有需要加強的學理基礎，可以自己跟指導教授討論去修習或旁聽學、碩班的課程，學術訓練上相對比較有量身定做、彈性的感覺。 但因為缺少明確的 milestones，如果學生沒有足夠動機自我推動研究進展，滿容易博士班四年讀不完而被迫退學。\n1 關於資格考：在英國常見的做法是，博士班學生會先註冊成為 MPhil 或 PRS (Probationer Research Student) 學生，大約在一年半或第四個學期後，會有升等（upgrade）考核。 在這個升等考核中，系上會召集專案小組（panel）考核學生至目前的研究進度是否有資格成為 PhD 學生。 這個升等考核相當於北美的資格考（qualification），假如通過了就會成為美國所謂的博士候選人 （PhD Candidate），只是這邊的人通常不會這樣稱呼。 但是，實際的作法仍因學校而異。北美博士班訓練比較有明確的通盤規劃，通常會有一到兩年的必/選修課程，接著通過資格考，最後才是撰寫博士論文的階段，學生會有明確的 milestones 要一步步達成。 訓練宗旨感覺比較接近「先廣博而後專精」，會希望學生在學術初期能夠廣泛接觸各個不同的研究次領域。 相對地，基於這樣的課程設計，北美博士班的訓練過程通常會比較長（5–7 年）。\n\n\n學校\n除了大家通常都會考量到的學校排名、學校聲望、研究專長、研究設施（像是我要做 fMRI 研究，總不好去選一間沒有 MRI 的學校）之外，其實學校所在地的非學術因素也很重要：\n\n氣候、所在地（五光十色的大城市 vs 杳無人煙的小城鎮）\n周邊實習機會（尤其是如果之後打算進業界）\n個人偏好與憧憬（像我自己就非常想去 Oxford 讀書）等\n\n每個人都有適合的生活與研究環境，這些通常不是考量學校時會直接想到的事情，但會是影響博班留學體驗很重要的因素。 畢竟要獨自在一個地方生活這麼多年，如果環境令人難以忍受，博班生活會很難熬過去。\n\n\n指導教授\n選擇指導教授（supervisor/advisor），通常會跟選學校綁在一起考量。 我個人（受到很多人影響與說服後）覺得選擇指導教授，是這三個層面中最重要的。 如何挑選指導教授，每個人都有自己的標準，以下分享我當初考量的一些因素。\n\n與指導教授的研究興趣契合度（議題、方法學）。\n指導教授的研究、發表近況。\n指導教授所在的學術階段2。\n\n「正教授」通常實驗室規模會比較大、學術資源豐沛、可能又剛好會是領域內的大佬，比較容易發論文，但同時他們通常都會有超級多的外務，實際指導你的時間可能會很少，甚至有可能準備要退休了，學術動能會開始下降。\n「助理教授」的情況剛好相反，實驗室規模較小、資源較少、名聲可能還沒建立起來，但為了要留在學術圈（但也有可能留不住），他們通常動機高昂，學術動能很大，會跟學生有比較密切地互動往來。\n「副教授」的情況介於上述兩者之間。\n\n\n2 英國學術職位的稱呼與北美、臺灣體系不同：Lecturer 對應的是助理教授、Senior Lecturer/Reader 對應的是副教授，這些老師都是可以負責指導博士生的。 不要誤會成專門負責教學的講師。\n指導教授本人的個性、指導風格。\n\n這件事情我覺得非常關鍵，但很難判斷。 在疫情之前常見的做法，是利用學術研討會期間進行面對面的交流，可以從中感受一下。 如果自己學、碩班期間的指導教授剛好認識，可以順便打聽一下；再來就是寫信聯絡該實驗室的博士生、博後詢問看看，通常他們都滿願意分享自身經驗的。 最後，通常在申請學校之前，會先寫信聯絡幾位可能的指導教授（potential supervisor/advisor），可以利用書信往返、私下面試的機會，感受一下其個性或做事風格，雖然很間接，但總是個機會。\n\n指導教授是否會讓學生掛在第一作者、是否會和學生共同有發表。\n這位指導教授所在的單位，是否至少有第二位老師的研究我有興趣。\n\n我覺得這個考量很有意思。其實我們都不確定在讀博班期間，會跟指導教授發生什麼事情，如果不幸沒辦法繼續維持原先的指導關係（雙方不合、老師離開原單位等各種原因），至少還有機會可以轉到別的實驗室繼續讀下去。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n分享一些選擇指導教授的文章給大家做參考，尤其推薦第二篇：\n\nChoosing a PhD Supervisor (FindAPhD blog)\nHow to Pick a Graduate Advisor (Barres, 2013, Neuron)\n\n\n\n最美好的情況當然是，理想的地區、學校、指導教授完美地重疊在一起，而且自己剛好又很有能力可以申請上這所學校。 但事情若不如人願，我個人的看法，以及最後的選擇是：以指導教授/實驗室為主。 對於讀博班來說，最重要的還是培養自己成為一個獨立的研究人員，在這個訓練過程中影響最大的，我認為會是自己最緊密接觸、合作的實驗室與指導教授。\n當然，這是我目前的看法，我還沒開始歷經這個過程，我不知道這個想法是否合適，如果之後有機會，我會再來更新這個部分。"

    "text": "Q3 | 如何取得英國博士班的經費（funding）？\n我的碩班指導教授曾告訴我，申請（英國）博士班需要兩個東西：錢、paper（但我目前沒有成功發出 paper）。 英國博士班通常不帶獎學金，對學生而言，這大概是跟北美博士班最大的差別之一。 在英國，博班申請跟獎學金申請通常是分開的，它可以給你 offer，但不給你錢，而且常常發生（即便在 Oxbridge 仍是如此）。\n以下我列出幾個臺灣學生有資格申請的英國博士班獎學金來源（這邊只列出額度足夠的獎學金）：\n\n教育部公費考試獎學金\n\n選校自由度最高，學費通常可以完全核銷掉（心理學上限四年 $120,000），外加根據就學城市給予的生活費（$23,000 or $21,000 per annum）。 目前有十五年內的返國義務規定，與多數高額獎學金相衝突。\n\n教育部與世界百大合作設置獎學金（牛津、劍橋限定）\n\n全額學費＋英國政府規定的博士班學生津貼（每年根據通膨調漲，比教育部公費獎學金生活費高）。 沒有返國義務。 牛津獎學金有非強制性的一些規定（無意圖於完成修業後於英國從事其因本獎學金所獲取技能之工作），劍橋的沒有。\n\nUKRI (UK Research and Innovation) 提供的博士班獎學金\n\n目前已經開放國際學生申請囉！\n福利最好的獎學金，通常包含本地生學費（看就讀的學校，排名不要太差的學校通常會幫忙補足本地生與國際生的差額）、英國政府規定的博士班學生津貼、小額研究經費、資助特定研究課程的修習等等。\n心理學博士班通常有資格申請 BBSRC, ESRC, MRC 這三個 research councils 的 studentships。 可以利用 FindAPhD、學校的 funding database 或是在各個指導教授實驗室網站查看相關訊息。 雖然開放國際生申請，但實際上申請到的國際生比率似乎非常低（UKRI 有明文規定國際生最多只會佔到 30%，但我目前查不到實際數據）。\n\n各個學校內提供國際生可以申請的獎學金（e.g., Gates Cambridge, Oxford Clarendon, UCL 的 RES）\n\n每個學校額度不同，有些會提供全額國際生獎學金、有些提供本地生與國際生之間的差額。通常競爭激烈。 要去每間學校的 funding database 查詢。\n\n\n相較於北美博士班以入學委員會共同挑選申請者的方式，英國的指導教授通常比較有權力與自由選擇自己的博班學生（當然學校還是有權力可以否決）。 當申請者符合學校入學要求、研究興趣相符、且有確定的資金來源（通常不包含 self-funding 這個選項），被錄取的機會就會提高不少\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n關於英國與北美博士班申請的差異，可以參考這篇文章：Americans Applying to UK PhDs: A Guide。"

    "text": "Q9 | 疑難雜症（Q）或建議（A）\n\nQ9.1 | 英國學位成績換算？\n英國大學部畢業成績不適用 GPA，而是以榮譽學位（honours degree system）來區分，由高而低分別為：\n\nFirst-Class (1st)\nUpper Second-Class (2.i)\nLower Second-Class (2.ii)\nThird-Class (3rd)\nFail\n\n基本上沒有任何標準方式可以直接轉換 GPA 與英國榮譽學位的對應，每間學校做法都不太一樣。 如果真的有疑問，最直接且精確的做法，就是寄信問 Admission Officer。 不要自己換算，CV 上不要亂寫。\n\n\nQ9.2 | 什麼時候考英文檢定？\n英文檢定成績可以在申請時就附上，通常也可以申請後再補送，而且不太會影響學校是否發錄取通知（只是 condition 或 unconditional 的差別而已）。 但還是建議大家可以早一點準備，有些成績門檻會比原先預期得困難（像是 IELTS 寫作 7.0）。 另外，大部分學校都接受 IELTS 或 TOEFL 作為英文能力證明。\n\n\nQ9.3 | 寫信要怎麼稱呼指導教授？\n指導教授有 full professor 的職位才以 Prof. 來指稱，否則都以 Dr 指稱。 其餘注意事項可以參考這篇文章。\n\n\nQ9.4 | 要考哪些英文考試？\n英國心理學博班通常只要考英文能力檢定（e.g., IELTS, TOEFL, PTE, Cambridge English, etc.），不需要考 GRE（即便是美國的心理學博班，近年來也愈來愈多系所不要求 GRE 成績了）。\n在 2020 的時候，為了增加自己之後申請學校的彈性，有花了大約三個月準備 GRE（包含補習兩個月＋自己考前練習一個月）。雖然申請過程中沒有使用到 GRE 分數，但準備 GRE 的過程對於自己英文實力的提升到是滿有感的。尤其是英文「邏輯閱讀」的訓練，會對於英文文章架構有更深入的理解，了解每個文句在段落中扮演的角色；對於申請過程中撰寫 SOP 或是 RP 都很有幫助，可以幫助自己找到寫作的邏輯漏洞。\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n我那時候是在 Mason GRE 上 GRE 密集班，我覺得算是經濟實惠的一個投資，課後也提供很多海外留學、工作的資訊與交流平台。他們也有提供很多免費的公開課可以參考。\n\n\n我之後會再撰寫一篇文章分享自己的英文學習經驗與資源（尤其是英式英文的部分）！\n\n\n\n💡 A9.1 | 可以辦一個學術 Bluesky/X 帳號。\nAcademic Bluesky/X 可以追蹤一些有在留意的學者，可以第一手知道其研究近況，也能了解目前學術界討論的議題，也可以學習其他人如何用相對少的文字來介紹、推廣自己的研究結果。而且很多博班申請（尤其是歐陸那種不定時開缺的，或是 UKRI-granted PhD 的機會）、獎學金或學術資源的資訊會在上面流通。\n可以參考這篇文章：A Beginner’s Guide to Joining Academic Twitter。\n\n\n💡 A9.2 | 好用的一些網站與資源。\n\nFindAPhD\nCantab English Blog  尤其推薦其「留學生活」相關的專欄文章。\nThe Student Room (TSR)  英國最大的學生論壇，有問題可以在上面找找看有沒有討論串。每年研究所申請都會有專門的討論串，壓力很大的話，可以在上面討論、抒發、取暖。\n亞瑟的留學軍團  由一位 UCLA 退休教授在臺大心理系創設，協助學生申請國外博班的組織。"

    "section": "",
    "text": "People differ in their levels of impulsivity and patience, and these preferences are heavily influenced by others. Previous research suggests that susceptibility to social influence may vary with age, but the mechanisms and whether people are more influenced by patience or impulsivity remain unknown. Here, using a delegated inter-temporal choice task and Bayesian computational models, we tested susceptibility to social influence in young (aged 18–36, N=76) and older (aged 60–80, N=78) adults. Participants completed a temporal discounting task and then learnt the preferences of two other people (one more impulsive and one more patient) before making their choices again. We used the signed Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the magnitude and direction of social influence. We found that, compared to young adults, older adults were relatively more susceptible to impulsive social influence. Factor analyses showed that older adults with higher self-reported levels of affective empathy and emotional motivation were particularly susceptible to impulsive influence. Importantly, older and young adults showed similar learning accuracy about others’ preferences, and their baseline impulsivity did not differ. Together, these findings suggest highly affectively empathetic and emotionally motivated older adults may be at higher risk for impulsive decisions, due to their susceptibility to social influence."

    "text": "People often adjust their behaviours and preferences to align with others, a phenomenon termed social inﬂuence or social contagion. Social inﬂuence can have a profound effect on our economic preferences, with important implications for ﬁnancial decision-making and making rational choices. Here we review recent ﬁndings in neuroeconomics, elucidating the psychological, computational, and neural mechanisms that underpin social inﬂuence during value-based decision-making. We examine how others’ decisions can shift our own economic preferences, regarding risk-taking, temporal discounting, effort discounting, and moral preferences. Additionally, we discuss the lifespan similarities and differences in susceptibility to social inﬂuence. Finally, we cover studies revealing the neural basis of susceptibility to social inﬂuence and highlight key common brain areas across studies that could underpin these effects. We end by considering the implications of strong evidence of susceptibility to social inﬂuence on economic preferences, the challenges and opportunities of this inﬂuence and how future studies could harness it to create positive changes across the lifespan."
