I am a PhD student in Psychology at the [Centre for Human Brain Health](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes/human-brain-health),
School of Psychology, [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). 
I am a recipient of the Government Scholarship for Overseas Study (公費留學獎學金), 
funded by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan.

I am supervised by Prof. [Patricia Lockwood](https://www.sdn-lab.org/), Prof. [Matthew Apps](https://www.msn-lab.com/), and Dr [Todd Vogel](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Yh8kB9MAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I am intrigued by the behavioural, computational and neural mechanisms underlying social learning and group decision-making in health, disease, and development. 
I am currently using Bayesian computational modelling to explore the causal role of mPFC in people’s susceptibility to social influence.
