I am a third-year PhD student in Psychology at the [Centre for Human Brain Health](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes/human-brain-health), [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), 
funded by the Government Scholarship for Overseas Study (公費留學獎學金) from the Ministry of Education in Taiwan.

Under the supervision of Prof. [Patricia Lockwood](https://www.sdn-lab.org/), Prof. [Matthew Apps](https://www.msn-lab.com/), and Dr [Todd Vogel](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Yh8kB9MAAAAJ&hl=en), 
my research explores the behavioural, computational and neural mechanisms underlying social learning and group decision-making in health, disease, and development. 
Currently, I am using Bayesian computational modelling to explore the causal role of mPFC in people’s susceptibility to social influence.
